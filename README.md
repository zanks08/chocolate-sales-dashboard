# 🍫 Chocolate Sales Dashboard 🍫

This is a **personal experiment dashboard project** where I explored how to build interactive visualizations using **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **Altair** — just to play around, try different visuals, and see how dynamic filtering works with real-world-style data.  

I used a chocolate sales dataset and tested how we can present it beautifully with modern Python tools

## Features

- Filter chocolate sales by **Country**, **Product**, and **Date Range**
- View quick metrics like **Total Sales**, **Boxes Shipped**, and **Total Orders**
